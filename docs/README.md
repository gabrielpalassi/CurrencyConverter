## Code Quality

To ensure code quality and consistency, the following tools are required and should be run from the root of the repository:

- **Formatting**: Use Prettier to automatically format your code according to the project's style guidelines.

  ```bash
  bun run format
  ```

- **Linting**: Employ ESLint to identify and address code quality issues.

  ```bash
  bun run lint
  ```

- **Format and Lint**: Run both formatting and linting in one step to ensure your code meets all quality standards.

  ```bash
  bun run format-and-lint
  ```

- **Pre-commit**: This script runs before each commit to enforce code quality. It performs formatting checks with Prettier and linting checks with ESLint, in that order. The commit will only proceed if all checks pass.

  ```bash
  bun run pre-commit
  ```
