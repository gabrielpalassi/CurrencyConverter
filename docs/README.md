## Code Quality

To ensure code quality and consistency, the following tools are required and should be run from the root of the repository:

- **Formatting**: Automatically format code using Prettier to adhere to the project's style guidelines.

  ```bash
  bun run format
  ```

- **Linting**: Check for and resolve code quality issues using ESLint.

  ```bash
  bun run lint
  ```

- **Pre-commit**: This script runs before each commit to enforce code quality. It performs formatting with Prettier and linting with ESLin, in that order. The commit will only proceed if all checks pass.

  ```bash
  bun run pre-commit
  ```
